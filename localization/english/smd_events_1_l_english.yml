Spanning between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the remote area has long lacked public transportation, forcing many to hitchhike—often with deadly consequences."

je_russian_constitutional_crisis: "Russian Constitutional Crisis"
je_russian_constitutional_crisis_reason: "The year 1993 has brought Russia to the brink of political collapse.\n\nPresident Boris Yeltsin, seeking to consolidate executive authority, has ordered the dissolution of the Russian parliament, accusing its members of obstructing reforms and resisting democratization. The parliament, in turn, has declared Yeltsin's decree unconstitutional, refusing to disband and rallying supporters to its cause.\n\nFor weeks, tensions mount as rival factions gain the backing of different elements of the military, security forces, and the general public. The government apparatus fractures, with loyalty to either the executive or legislative branch determining the fate of the Russian Federation.\n\nThis confrontation is more than a political dispute — it is a battle over the very nature of Russia's governance in the post-Soviet era. Should the crisis spiral out of control, civil violence in the heart of Moscow is not only possible, but inevitable."

je_russia_wild_nineties: "The Wild Nineties"
je_russia_wild_nineties_reason: "The ‘The wild nineties’ (Russian: Лихие девяностые, Likhiye devyanostyye) is a term with a negative evaluative connotation, characterising the period of the transition period after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russian Federation's formation in the 1990s. \n\nRussia’s turbulent transition from Soviet rule to a capitalist democracy has unleashed a wave of instability, corruption, and violence. The early post-Soviet years have been marked by economic collapse, the rise of oligarchs, political showdowns, and a surge in organized crime.\n\nFrom the shelling of parliament to the privatization scandals, each month seems to bring new upheavals. The country teeters between reform and chaos, and the people’s patience wears thin."

je_haiti_political_crisis: "Haitian Political Crisis"
je_haiti_political_crisis_reason: "Following the democratic election of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1990, Haiti experienced a brief moment of optimism. However, the fragile stability was shattered in September 1991 when a military coup ousted Aristide, plunging the country into political chaos.\n\nThe military regime faced international condemnation, as human rights abuses and political repression became widespread. Economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the Organization of American States severely impacted Haiti’s already struggling economy.\n\nThroughout 1992 and 1993, negotiations between the military junta and Aristide’s supporters faltered, while violence against political opponents and the general population intensified. Attempts by the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to restore democratic governance met with obstruction.\n\nBy 1994, mounting pressure from the international community, particularly the United States, set the stage for direct intervention. Operation Uphold Democracy, led by U.S. forces in September 1994, aimed to restore Aristide to power and bring an end to the junta’s rule."

je_quebec_happiness: "The Quebec Situation"
je_quebec_happiness_reason: "The status of Quebec within Canada has been a contentious issue for decades. Quebec’s distinct culture, language, and history have often fueled debates about autonomy and independence.\n\nIn the years leading up to the 1995 Quebec Referendum, the relationship between Quebec and the federal government of Canada has been marked by tension, negotiation, and the occasional flare-up of nationalist sentiment.\n\nThe province of Quebec, with its unique French-speaking majority, distinct cultural identity, and long history of advocating for autonomy, has periodically sought to redefine its place within the Canadian federation. Some Quebecois desire complete independence, others wish for increased provincial powers, while many still support remaining in a unified Canada.\n\nAs Prime Minister, your task is to navigate this delicate situation. You must balance national unity with respect for Quebec's cultural and political aspirations. Every decision you make — whether on language laws, economic policy, or cultural investment — will influence the happiness of the Quebecois population.\n\nIf the Quebec Happiness score remains high, the referendum may end with a vote to stay in Canada. But if discontent grows too strong, the people of Quebec may vote for independence, forever altering the map of North America."
