Membership brings the promise of free movement of goods, services, capital, and people — an unprecedented opportunity for prosperity.\n\nYet, the Union is not without its challenges. Members must navigate complex negotiations, abide by supranational regulations, and compromise on elements of national sovereignty. The deeper integration grows, the more each member's fate is bound to that of the collective.\n\nWhether a country thrives or struggles within the EU depends on its ability to balance national interests with the common good, forging a path within a union that aims to be more than the sum of its parts."
